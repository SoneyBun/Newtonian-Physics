g üìñ
--
- The acceleration due to gravity
- Gravitational field strength
- g = 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>

---

Mass üìñ
--
Amount of matter in an object

Weight üìñ
--
Gravitational force on an object

Force üìñ
--
Any push or pull exerted on one object by another object

---

Newton (N) üßÆ
--
Kg x m/s<sup>2</sup>

---

Newton's Universal Law Of Graviation ‚≠ê
--
F<sub>g</sub> = G x (Mm/R<sup>2</sup>) = mg
>G = 6.67 x 10<sup>-11</sup> Nm<sup>2</sup> / Kg<sup>2</sup>

Newton's Laws Of Motion
--

>[!Note]
>An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an outside [unbalanced] force.

- Balanced forces do nto cause acceleration.

Inertia üìñ
--
- Because all matter is lazy. (mass)
- Property of matter to resist forces.

>[!Note]
>Unbalanced forces will cause an object to accelerate in the same direction as the net force, directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

- Inversely proportional to the mass of an object
- The net force applied to an object will cause it to accelerate in the direction of the net force and directly proportional to the magnitude of the object.
- F<sub>net</sub> = ma = Œ£F
- Unbalanced forces cause acceleration

3 ways to accelerate
- speed up
- slow down
- change direction

>[!NOTE]
>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction

- If i apply a force to an object, it will apply a force that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to me.
- F<sub>AB</sub> = -F<sub>BA</sub>
- The force applied to an object is limited to the weaker object
  - Punching drywall vs punching concrete wall

Forces come in pairs

Fundamental Forces

(Strongest to weakest)

1 ~ Strong Force
-
Holds nucleus together. 

2 ~ Weak Force
-
Holds electrons in orbitals.

3 ~ Electromagnetic Force
-
Force of magnets.

Types Of Forces

Q: Is object accelerating?
A: If not, it is balanced.

1: Contact Forces
-
Requires direction contact.
- Normal Force (Perpendicular) F<sub>n</sub>
  - Surfaces always apply a force perpendicular to the force applied to it.
- Friction Force (Parallel) (Opposite)
  - Kinetic Friction (Sliding) f<sub>K</sub> = Œº<sub>K</sub>F<sub>N</sub>
  - Static Friction f<sub>S</sub> ‚â§ Œº<sub>S</sub>F<sub>N</sub>
- Drag Force F<sub>air</sub>
- Tension (String/Rope) F<sub>T</sub>
- Spring/Elastic F<sub>el</sub> = -KX
   - K = Stretchiness
   - X = Stretch Distance
- Applied Force F<sub>A</sub>
  

2: Field Forces
-
Can act over a distance
- Electromagnetic F<sub>e</sub>
- Gravitational "Weight" F<sub>g</sub>
