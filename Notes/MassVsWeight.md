g 📖
--
- The acceleration due to gravity
- Gravitational field strength
- g = 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>

---

Mass 📖
--
Amount of matter in an object

Weight 📖
--
Gravitational force on an object

Force 📖
--
Any push or pull exerted on one object by another object

---

Newton (N) 🧮
--
Kg x m/s<sup>2</sup>

---

Newton's Universal Law Of Graviation ⭐
--
F<sub>g</sub> = G x (Mm/R<sup>2</sup>) = mg
>G = 6.67 x 10<sup>-11</sup> Nm<sup>2</sup> / Kg<sup>2</sup>

Newton's Laws Of Motion
--

>[!Note]
>An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an outside [unbalanced] force

- Balanced forces do nto cause acceleration.

Inertia 📖
--
- Because all matter is lazy. (mass)
- Property of matter to resist forces.


- Inversely proportional to the mass of an object
- The net force applied to an object will cause it to accelerate in the direction of the net force and directly proportional to the magnitude of the object.
- F<sub>net</sub> = ma
- Unbalanced forces cause acceleration
